## About 📋

This is a minimalisic and easy to use weather app. It is designed to show only the pertinent information about the weather such as current temperature, humidity, UV index and future forecasts of any cities you desire. If you are planning on traveling or just need to check the weather of certain place(s) but don't need all of the other useless information that crowds the space or has a bunch of ads for no reason, then this is perfect for you.

## Usage Instructions 💻

The default location is Irvine, CA. Whenever you want to look for a city, just enter that city in the search bar at the top of the right side and the weather information will populate. The right side will display the current weather of that location according to the current time you are searching it at. The left side displays the 6-day future forecast of the searched location. Once you search another location, you will be able to see your search history. If you would like to go to the back to the past locations you searched for, you can click on one of the past cities at the bottom of the right side. If you would like to remove them, click on ⚡️.
